# Magento 2 Security 

## Overview 
Security issues for Magento have left a big question mark in the community of online stores. This problem is specially cared when Magento-based stores which own critical information and huge transactional volume can easily become ideal prey for blackhat hackers to attack. To help online stores prevent brutal break-ins, Mageplaza has developed the Security extension.

**Magento 2 Security extension** gives store owners the ability to detect the IP addresses that are intentionally attacking their store at any given time. Therefore, they have timely measures to prevent this issue such as blocking those IP addresses or sending warning emails to store owners.

## How to use
You can review login records from the dashboard when entering the backend. The log displays the newest 5 logins and you can click on the login name to view the details.

* In the **Blacklist(s)** field:
  *  All IP addresses filled in this section will be blocked whenever accessing the admin login page.
  * You are able to block one IP address, multiple IP addresses, an IP address range or multiple IP address ranges.  IP addresses are separated with commas ``,``.
  * You can also block IP addresses as wildcard masks as below:
    * ``10.0.0. *``
    * ``10.0. *. *``
    * ``10.0.0. * - 123.0.0. *``
    * ``12.3. *. * - 222.0. *. *``
 * The mark ``*`` is in the `0 - 255` range.*
* In the **Whitelist(s)** field:
  * All IP addresses that are filled in this section will be allowed whenever accessing the admin login page.
  * You can allow one IP address, multiple IP addresses, an IP address range or multiple IP address ranges.  IP addresses are separated with commas ``,``.
  * You can also allow IP addresses as wildcard masks as these follows:
    * ``10.0.0. *``
    * ``10.0. *. *``
    * ``10.0.0. * - 123.0.0. *``
    * ``12.3. *. * - 222.0. *. *``
 * The mark ``*`` is in the `0 - 255` range.*

```
Blacklist(s) has higher priority than Whitelist(s) which means if a IP address is in the Blacklist, it will be blocked even it's in the Whitelist as well. So please make sure that you've added your IP address in the Whitelist only. 
```

### II. Login Log
From the admin panel, make your way to ``System > Security > Login Log``. All logins and login attempts will be recorded here.

### Reset Command line

* If store admins mistakenly enter their IP addresses in the Blacklist, this following command lines can be run first: 
```
bin/magento security:reset blacklist 
```
Next, run this command line:
```
bin/magento cache:flush
```
*  After you have finished running those above command lines which reset the **Blacklist(s)** field, you will be able to access the admin page again. Note that the **Blacklist(s)** field is reset now so don’t forget to reenter the blacklist IPs.
* Similarly, the **Whitelist(s)** can be reset using these command lines: 
```
bin/magento security:reset whitelist
bin/magento cache:flush
```
* If you run the command ``bin/magento security:reset``, both **Blacklist(s)** and **Whitelist(s)** will be reset.
